# Regex and POS Tagger in Natural Processing Language.
- This repository contains code for performing linguistic analysis on natural language text using regular expressions and part-of-speech (POS) tagging. The code is written in Python and can be used to extract specific patterns or tags from text corpora.

## Getting Started
To use this code, simply clone the repository to your local machine:

```
git clone https://github.com/VigneshwaranBS/Regex-and-Pos-Tagger-In-NLP.git
```

After cloning the repository, you can run the code using the following command:

```
python Part_of_speech.py
```
```
python Regular Expressions.py
```

This will execute the nlp_analysis.py script, which loads a sample dataset and applies regular expressions and POS tagging to extract specific patterns and tags.

## Dependencies
The project has the following dependencies:

- Python 3.x
- NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)
- Spacy

## You can install NLTK using pip:

 ```
pip install nltk
```
```
pip install spacy
```
